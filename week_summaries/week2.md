# Object Recognition
For the stage of Object Recognition we have tested different CNN architectures on different datasets. More precisely, we have tested the VGG16 model, the Inception V3, a ResNet of 50 layers and a Wide Residual Network, presented [in this paper] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07146.pdf). The datasets used to evaluate these CNN architectures are the [TT100K dataset](http://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/traffic-sign/), the [BelgiumTS dataset](http://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/) and the [KITTI dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php). The first two are for traffic sign recognition, whereas KITTI is a more generic object recognition dataset and it has classes such as car, pedestrian or truck.
